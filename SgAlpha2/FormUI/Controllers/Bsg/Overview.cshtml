                    You could get a one-off payment of &pound;500 to help towards the costs of having a child.
                    This is known as a Sure Start Maternity Grant.
                </p>

                <p>You usually qualify for the grant if both of the following apply:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>you’re expecting your first child, or you’re expecting a multiple birth (such as twins) and have children already</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>you or your partner already get certain benefits.</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    You must claim the grant within 11 weeks of the baby’s due date or within 3 months after the baby’s birth.
                </p>

                <p>
                    You don’t have to pay the grant back and it won’t affect your other benefits or tax credits.
                </p>
