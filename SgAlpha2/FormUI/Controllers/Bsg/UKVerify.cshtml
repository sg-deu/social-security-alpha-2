               <p>
                   You can continue your application without confirming who you are. The Social Security Agency will confirm this for you. This may delay your application as we may have to contact you.

            <p>
                To confirm who you are now you need to use Verify. This should mean your application is processed quicker.

            <h3>If you've not used Verify before</h3>
            <p>
                You need to have 1 or more of the following to use this:
                <ul>

            <h3>Already registered with Verify</h3>
            <p>
                If you've used Verify before, you'll need to know:
                <ul>
                    <li>what service you used to confirm who you are, for example Post Office</li>
                    <li>your login details</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <p>
                Check the email you were sent when you registered. If you can't find the information, contact 01010 101 010.
